# Advance_Fake_News_Detection
Uses BERT model to classify if a news is true or fake.
This project explores a comprehensive approach that integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) and multi-modal techniques for detecting fake news. 
It highlights the use of state-of-the-art NLP models, particularly BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), which plays a central role in analyzing 
and interpreting textual data.
The project uses a pre-defined data set with classifications of news and fake or true.
Further it explores the pre-trained BERT model to classify whether the news is fake or true.
